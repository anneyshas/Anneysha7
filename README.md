- 👋 [hand wave] Hi, I’m Anneysha!
- ✨ [sparkle]   Most of my repos are public - even the most basic, beginner codes. I love showing my progress. :)
- 🌈 [rainbow]   I will add a list of my best projects as links below my introduction and will pin those as well.
- 📫 [mailbox]   Please email me at anneysha(dot)sarkar070(at)gmail(dot)com
